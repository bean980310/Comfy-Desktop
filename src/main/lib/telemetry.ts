/**
 * Main-process telemetry — single capture point for the launcher.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 * REFERENCE FOR ANYONE ADDING NEW TELEMETRY
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * ## Architecture (one paragraph)
 *
 * `posthog-node` runs here in main. Renderer events flow over IPC
 * (`window.api.captureTelemetry` / `captureExceptionTelemetry` /
 * `registerTelemetryProperties` / `telemetryBindUserId` /
 * `telemetryUnbindUserId` / `telemetryGetExperimentFlag` /
 * `telemetryRecordExposure`) to handlers in `ipc/registerTelemetryHandlers.ts`.
 * Datadog RUM still runs in the renderer (browser-only) but is gated to a
 * small failure-event allow-list in `src/shared/datadogMirroredEvents.ts`.
 *
 * ## Adding a product event — checklist
 *
 *   1. Pick a name. Convention: `comfy.desktop.<area>.<verb>` snake_case
 *      (e.g. `comfy.desktop.instance.switched`). Add to whichever code path
 *      naturally owns the event.
 *   2. Use `capture(event, properties)` in main, or
 *      `emitTelemetryAction(event, props)` in a Vue component. Never call
 *      `posthog.capture` directly.
 *   3. Bucket / enumerate user values at the call site. Free-form strings
 *      get scrubbed by `scrubAll()` as a safety net, but the discipline is
 *      to send `directory_bucket: 'checkpoints'` not raw `directory: '/Users/x/foo'`.
 *      Use helpers in `src/renderer/src/lib/telemetry.ts` (`toSizeBucket`,
 *      `toCountBucket`, `toErrorBucket`, `toModelDirectoryBucket`,
 *      `deriveGpuTier`, etc.) — extend them instead of inlining new bucketing.
 *   4. If the event is a *failure* (`*.error`, crash, install failure, etc.),
 *      add the event name to `DATADOG_MIRRORED_EVENT_NAMES` so it also
 *      reaches Datadog and a monitor can fire on it.
 *   5. Add an insight to the relevant PostHog dashboard. Don't ship events
 *      that don't end up on a dashboard or in a saved query — that's how
 *      telemetry rots into noise.
 *
 * ## Identity model
 *
 *   - `installation_id` = `SHA-256(machine_id + salt)`, from `deviceId.ts`.
 *     The anonymous distinct_id. INVARIANT: never pass it to
 *     `client.identify()` — PostHog would mark it identified, and it won't
 *     merge one identified id into another, so the login alias below silently
 *     no-ops (prod: 0/13,528 stitched). Anonymous person-prop writes go
 *     through capture-`$set` instead, which updates the person without
 *     identifying the id.
 *   - `download_token` (TODO): web → desktop acquisition bridge.
 *   - `user_id`: set on login via `bindUserId`. The ONLY `client.identify()`
 *     call. Aliases `installation_id` → `user_id` (now merges, since the anon
 *     id was never identified). Logout (`unbindUserId`) restores the anon
 *     distinct_id — not `posthog.reset()`, which would clobber it.
 *
 * ## Consent (three-state)
 *
 *   - `'granted'`   — collect everything.
 *   - `'denied'`    — collect nothing.
 *   - `'undecided'` — fresh install or Desktop-1 migrator; collect ONLY
 *                     `comfy.desktop.first_use.consent_decision` until the
 *                     user makes a choice.
 *
 *   Every capture path here is consent-gated. `setConsentState(state)` is
 *   the single source of truth; `setConsent(bool)` is a legacy adapter.
 *
 * ## Provider split
 *
 *   PostHog gets everything. Datadog only mirrors the failure / reliability
 *   allow-list in `src/shared/datadogMirroredEvents.ts`. Datadog is for
 *   alerting, not analysis — adding a name to the allow-list is a
 *   deliberate ops decision ("I want a monitor on this"). PostHog
 *   dashboards + ad-hoc HogQL are the source of truth for everything else.
 *
 * ## A/B experiments
 *
 *   `experiments.ts` owns the flag cache. Read with `getFlag(key)` in main
 *   or `window.api.telemetryGetExperimentFlag(key)` from the renderer
 *   (cache-first; first-ever boot fails closed to control). Record
 *   exposure with `recordExposure(key, variant, source)` or its IPC
 *   equivalent — per-session dedup is enforced main-side. Outcome events
 *   are normal product events; PostHog joins them to the exposure at query
 *   time via the standard experiment view.
 *
 * ## What NOT to do
 *
 *   - Don't ship raw file paths, prompts, model filenames, user-typed
 *     strings. Bucket or hash them first.
 *   - Don't call `posthog.reset()` on logout.
 *   - Don't add events that nobody is going to look at in PostHog. Add
 *     them to a dashboard or skip them.
 *   - Don't bypass `bucketError`; if you need a new error category, extend
 *     `src/shared/errorBucket.ts` so main and renderer classify the same way.
 *   - Don't fire events synchronously inside hot loops (e.g. every render
 *     of a Vue list). Throttle / dedup at the call site.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * NOTE: There is intentionally no remote kill-switch / sample-rate system
 * (that grab-bag was deliberately removed). `experiments.ts` brought back
 * the flag-evaluation subset only, for A/B testing. Don't recreate the
 * kill-switch without a concrete need.

/**
 * SDK-level volume safety net — two layers, both belt-and-braces around
 * the per-call-site dedup guards that individual emit paths add.
 *
 * Motivation: the 2026-06-02 volume incident shipped 3M+ events of the
 * same four `comfy.desktop.app_update.*` names in 24h before anyone noticed.
 * The per-call fix in `updater.ts` prevents *that specific* loop, but
 * any future emit-in-a-tight-loop bug (a Vue watcher that fires on
 * every render, an IPC handler called every animation frame, a
 * setInterval misconfigured to 100ms instead of 10min) would do the
 * same damage. These two limits make the WORST case bounded even when
 * the call site is buggy.
 *
 * Layer 1: per-event-name sliding window.
 *   Drop further emits of the same event name once 60 fire in 60s.
 *   60/min is well above any legitimate product event rate (the
 *   loudest healthy event was `execution.completed` at ~36/user/day)
 *   and well below any loop signature (the incident was ~2/sec).
 *   One `comfy.desktop.telemetry.rate_limited` warning fires per (event ×
 *   process) so dashboards surface that it happened.
 *
 * Layer 2: per-process total cap.
 *   After 5000 events captured this process, every further capture
 *   no-ops. 5000 covers a heavy multi-hour workflow user (~500–1000
 *   events) with 5–10x headroom, and turns "millions of events" into
 *   "at most 5000" for any single runaway install. One
 *   `comfy.desktop.telemetry.session_cap_hit` warning fires once when the
 *   cap is crossed.
 *
 * `*.error` events bypass Layer 1 — error volume is exactly the signal
 * we need most during incidents, and `*.error` events are not the
 * shape of any loop we've seen. Layer 2 still applies (a runaway
 * error loop would still hit the cap).
